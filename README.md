DataMiningProject.ipynb: This is the jupyter notebook which contains all of our code for the project. Here is where we complete all the tasks, including cleaning the data, feature engineering, and running the model in Darwin.

datasets/: This is the folder where all of our initial and final datasets are contained.

datasets/BechdelTest.csv: This dataset contains the information on whether films pass the Bechdel Test or not.

datasets/IMDBMovieDatabase.csv: From this dataset, we gather the votes, mpaa, one-hot encoded genres, and length features.

datasets/MovieBudgetsAndBoxOfficeEarnings.csv: This dataset provides us with budget and gross income features for films.

datasets/film_data.csv: This is the transformed file of film_imdb.json.

datasets/film_imdb.json: This file provides us with information on directors, writers, and actors for each film.

datasets/result_data.csv: This is our final dataset which we send to Darwin. It contains the cleaned and feature engineered data.

The rest of the files included are from the Darwin SDK.
